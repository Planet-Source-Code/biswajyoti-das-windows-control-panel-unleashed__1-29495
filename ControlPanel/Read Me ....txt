Hi folks! this is one code that you will really enjoy if you are ia fix like
I was a few days back when I wanted to call control panel functions and that
too the appropriate one ... my lil niece (who has just strted VB)  asked me
if I can call the Display option of Control Panel and then when it opens it
shows the ScreenSaver Tab .. well I did manage to call the Display Properties
but never got the ScreenSaver tab to start as default .. I made this code for
helping those who needs info about Displaying the indicated Windows settings
dialog.
Last but not the least this is first code I am dedicating to someone. I dedicate
this code to my lovely lil niece Sanu as she was the first one to put me thinking
about the stuff ....

Please vote for me if you think it comes of any help to you ..
Thank you for downloading ...
