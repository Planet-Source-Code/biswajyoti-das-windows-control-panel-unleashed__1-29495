## Windows Control Panel \.\.\.\. UNLEASHED\!\!\!


</div>

### Description

Hi folks! this is one code that you will really enjoy if you are ia fix like

I was a few days back when I wanted to call control panel functions and that

too the appropriate one ... my lil niece (who has just strted VB) asked me

if I can call the Display option of Control Panel and then when it opens it

shows the ScreenSaver Tab .. well I did manage to call the Display Properties

but never got the ScreenSaver tab to start as default .. I made this code for

helping those who needs info about Displaying the indicated Windows settings

dialog.

Last but not the least this is first code I am dedicating to someone. I dedicate

this code to my lovely lil niece Sanu as she was the first one to put me thinking

about the stuff ....

Please vote for me .. I badly need some votes ....

Thank you ...
